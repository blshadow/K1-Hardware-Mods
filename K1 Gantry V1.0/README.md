## INTRODUCTION
Main reason for the creation of this mod was to fix the issue of the gantry not being square in my machine throwing off the mesh. It has since fixed the "unlevel" or "warped" bed and has also resulted in quieter operation of the printer. Having a custom gantry also opens the door to future upgrades/mods. These mounts have gone through weeks of testing and have proven to be more than capable of handling the K1.

The V1 Gantry uses the factory steppers, pulleys and other hardware. The V2 does not.

## IMPORTANT
 
 1. Consider this a WORK IN PROGRESS
 2. You are downloading/installing this mod willingly
 3. We are not reponsible/liable for any damage caused
 4. Do not use heat inserts shorter than the recommended
 5. Just because it fixed my issues it does not mean it will fix yours
 6. This mod requires you use the factory idlers pulleys
 7. You will need to shorten/modify the cable raceway covers

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Rigidity is important. Print the mounts using the recommended print settings or better
- You will need to remove all idler pulleys from the factory mounts. That can be done by removing the glue or simply drilling a small hole on the opposite end and pushing out the 4mm shafts
- Clean and lubricate the idler pulleys with fresh grease to minimize noise
- Place the idler pulleys in the mounts using the factory 4mm shafts (except the tensioner - it uses a M4 screw) and do not forget the 4mm washer/spacer
- Push the heat-set inserts into place as straight as possible or you will end up with alignment issues with the holes in the frame
- Make sure the inserts sit flush and that you don't heat the surrounding plastic more than necessary
- Insert two M3 Hex Nuts into the appropriate slots for the belt tensioners 
- Use M5x5mm grub screws to hold the 4mm shafts in the front idler mounts and the Y axis rods on all mounts
- Snug the Y rod grub screws after installing the gantry in the printer
