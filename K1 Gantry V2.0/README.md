## INTRODUCTION
Main reason for the creation of this mod was to fix the issue of the gantry not being square in my machine throwing off the mesh. It has since fixed the "unlevel" or "warped" bed and has also resulted in quieter operation of the printer. Having a custom gantry also opens the door to future upgrades/mods. These mounts have gone through weeks of testing and have proven to be more than capable of handling the K1. 

With the V2 Gantry, replacing the factory steppers and 36t timing gears resulted in a massive drop in vibrations in the gantry. Moving the belt tensioners to the front idler mounts has also made it much easier to tension the belts and fixed the issue of the factory tensioner buckling in the factory stepper mounts.

The V1 Gantry uses the factory steppers, pulleys and other hardware. The V2 does not.

## IMPORTANT
 
 1. Consider this a WORK IN PROGRESS
 2. You are downloading/installing this mod willingly
 3. We are not reponsible/liable for any damage caused
 4. Do not use heat inserts shorter than the recommended
 5. Just because it fixed my issues it does not mean it will fix yours
 6. This mod does not use factory steppers or hardware
 7. The 20T timing gears are 20mm tall
 8. You will need to change the rotation distance accordingly (40 for 20T Timing Gear)
 9. You will need to tune sensorless homing
 10. Will not work with factory door hinges (check 'USEFUL LINKS')
 11. Not 100% compatible with the FatBoy joints. Belts touch the housing slightly. I recommend sticking with Omran's regular joints (V3.1-3.3)

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Rigidity is important. Print the mounts using the recommended print settings or better
- Push the heat-set inserts into place as straight as possible or you will end up with alignment issues with the holes in the frame
- Make sure the inserts sit flush and that you don't heat the surrounding plastic more than necessary
- The stepper motors need to be screwed into the mounts before the pulleys
- Use M5x5mm grub screws to hold the Y axis rods on all mounts
- Snug the Y rod grub screws after installing the gantry in the printer
